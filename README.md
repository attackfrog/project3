# Project 3: Pinocchio's

*Web Programming with Python and JavaScript*

I'm sorry to say I ran out of time on this one, so there's a lot of missing functionality. What's here are the data structures storing the menu items, creating an account and logging in and out, viewing the menu, and the item-ordering process up until the actual insertion of the item into the shopping cart. 

If I'd had more time on this one I'm sure I could have figured it out, but that didn't end up working out and here we are. Well, now to focus on the final project!
